<b>🌟 Overview</b> <br>
VoiceLens is an innovative AI-powered accessibility platform that bridges the digital divide by converting text into natural, human-like speech. Designed with inclusivity at its core, VoiceLens empowers visually impaired individuals, dyslexic readers, non-native speakers, and multitaskers to access digital content through high-quality audio.

"Breaking barriers, one word at a time" - Making digital content accessible to everyone, regardless of abilities or preferences.

<b>🎯 Problem Statement</b><br>
In today's digital age, over 1 billion people worldwide face challenges with traditional text-based content:

🦯 285 million visually impaired individuals struggle with written content

📚 15-20% of the population has dyslexia or reading difficulties

🌍 1.5 billion English learners need pronunciation assistance

📱 67% of users prefer audio content for multitasking

Traditional solutions are either too expensive, lack natural voice quality, or don't support multiple languages effectively.

<b>✨ Key Features</b><br>

160+ Natural Voices across multiple languages and accents

Real-time Audio Generation with WebSocket streaming
